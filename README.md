# Node JS POC Project
A NodeJS project designed to learn the ins and outs of NodeJS.

This project will be used to learn NodeJS.  Target audience is developers who have used other Web Development frameworks, namely .NET MVC / API v2.

This project will grow in complexity as new techniques are incorporated.  The idea is to start with the most trivial examples using as few dependencies as possible and expand from there.  As a result, many instructions for installing dependencies will happen later in the development process than they would for a more seasoned Node developer.  

This project will also serve to document each step, no matter how trivial, during the setup process.
